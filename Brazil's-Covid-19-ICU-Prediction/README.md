# Project - ML Model Development Based on Brazil’s COVID-19 Dataset  

## Description  
Brazil is among the nations most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with over 16 million confirmed cases and 454,429 confirmed fatalities by May 26, 2021 (according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center).

During the first wave of COVID-19, Brazil faced unprecedented challenges due to the strain on hospital capacity, including high demand for ICU beds, healthcare professionals, personal protection equipment, and medical resources.

To address this issue, a team of data scientists at Sirio Libanês Hospital in Brazil sought to reduce ICU bed strain by developing a machine learning model. The model's goal is to predict whether patients with confirmed COVID-19 cases would require ICU admission.

The dataset used for this project, released on the Kaggle platform (Dataset Link), includes clinical data from COVID-19 patients and the target group (those admitted to the ICU).

This project focuses on building a classification model to predict ICU admission.

## Scope and Deliverables  

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualize data distributions, relationships, and trends.  
   - Identify missing values and potential outliers.  

2. **Data Pre-Processing**  
   - Handle missing values and outliers.  
   - Normalize and encode features as necessary.  
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.  

3. **Model Creation and Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - Train and evaluate different classification models.  
   - Optimize the model using hyperparameter tuning.  

4. **Conclusion**  
   - Summarize key findings and model performance.  
   - Provide recommendations based on predictions.
